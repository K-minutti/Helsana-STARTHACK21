# START Hack 2021 - Helsana Case

### Case Introduction
People have collected tons of data about themself. We want to create a service to show them how healthy they actually are. You are totally free how you can do that. We have some ideas like a Health Score, Avatar, Dashboard but we are very open for new ideas.

Secondly we want to implement a recomendation engine to help the user increase their health.
